### **📌 Understanding `TypedDict` and `State` in Python**
The code snippet:

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    graph_state: str
```

defines a **typed dictionary** (`TypedDict`) named `State`, which enforces that `graph_state` should always be a `str`.

---

## **🚀 What is `TypedDict`?**
`TypedDict` is a feature from Python’s `typing` module that allows defining **structured dictionaries with type annotations**.

✅ **Ensures type safety** → Helps detect type mismatches in dictionaries.  
✅ **Useful for LangGraph** → Defines **structured AI states** in multi-step workflows.  
✅ **Compatible with IDEs & Linters** → Works well with **MyPy & Pylance** for static analysis.

## **📌 What Does the `State` Class Do?**
In the code:

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    graph_state: str
```
✔ `State` is a dictionary **that must contain a `graph_state` key**.  
✔ **Example of a valid instance**:

```python
state_data: State = {"graph_state": "processing"}
print(state_data["graph_state"])  # Output: processing
```

✔ **Example of an invalid instance** (**raises a type error** in static checking):
```python
state_data: State = {"graph_state": 42}  # ❌ Type Error: Expected str, got int
```
