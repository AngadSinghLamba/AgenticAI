# **📌 LangGraph: Graph-Based AI Workflows in LangChain**  
**LangGraph** is a framework built on **LangChain** that enables **multi-step, stateful, and structured AI workflows** using **graph-based execution**.

---

## **🚀 Why Use LangGraph?**
✔ **Directed Graph Execution** – Uses **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** for structured AI workflows.  
✔ **Multi-Step Reasoning** – Supports **decision-making, conditional logic, and loops**.  
✔ **Stateful Execution** – Maintains **context across multiple steps**.  
✔ **Parallel Processing** – Runs **multiple nodes simultaneously**.  
✔ **LLM Integration** – Works **seamlessly with OpenAI, Hugging Face, and custom models**.

## **🛠 Components of LangGraph**
LangGraph structures AI workflows into **nodes and edges**, where:
- **Nodes** → Represent **tasks or functions** (e.g., calling an LLM, fetching data).  
- **Edges** → Define the **flow of execution** between nodes.  

| **Component** | **Function** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Graph Execution Model** | Defines AI workflow as a directed graph (DAG). |
| **State Management** | Stores memory across multiple steps. |
| **Nodes (Tasks)** | Perform actions like calling an LLM or retrieving data. |
| **Edges (Flow)** | Connect nodes to decide execution order. |
| **Parallel Execution** | Allows multiple nodes to run at the same time. |
| **Conditional Branching** | AI can take different paths based on user input. |

---

## **📌 How LangGraph Works**
1️⃣ **User provides input** → The AI **processes tasks in a directed graph**.  
2️⃣ **Graph determines execution flow** → AI **calls functions, retrieves data, or queries LLMs**.  
3️⃣ **AI can branch, loop, and make decisions** → Different paths execute based on logic.  
4️⃣ **Final response is generated** → AI combines outputs from **various nodes**.

## **🚀 Example: Simple LangGraph Workflow**
Let’s build a **graph-based chatbot** that:
1. **Classifies user input** as either **AI-related** or **General**.  
2. **Generates a response** using OpenAI’s GPT-4.  

---

### **🔹 Step 1: Install LangGraph**
```bash
pip install langchain langgraph openai
```

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Define a State Model**
A **state model** stores data **across steps**.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define state structure
class ChatState:
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message
        self.response = None
```

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Create Workflow Nodes**
Define **functions** that act as **graph nodes**.

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", openai_api_key="your_api_key")

# Classifies the query as AI-related or General
def classify_topic(state: ChatState):
    if "AI" in state.message:
        return "ai_response"
    return "general_response"

# Generate AI-related response
def ai_response(state: ChatState):
    state.response = llm.invoke(state.message)
    return state

# Generate General response
def general_response(state: ChatState):
    state.response = "This is a general knowledge response."
    return state
```

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Create the Graph**
```python
workflow = StateGraph(ChatState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("classify", classify_topic)
workflow.add_node("ai_response", ai_response)
workflow.add_node("general_response", general_response)

# Define execution flow
workflow.set_entry_point("classify")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("classify", {"AI": "ai_response", "General": "general_response"})
workflow.add_edge("ai_response", END)
workflow.add_edge("general_response", END)

# Compile the graph
graph = workflow.compile()
```

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Run the AI Chatbot**
```python
# Create input state
input_state = ChatState(message="Tell me about AI.")

# Run graph-based execution
output_state = graph.invoke(input_state)
print(output_state.response)  # AI-generated response

input_state = ChatState(message="Tell me about history.")
output_state = graph.invoke(input_state)
print(output_state.response)  # General response
```
✔ **AI automatically selects the right response path!** 🎉
