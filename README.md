### **📌 What is Agentic AI?**
**Agentic AI** refers to **AI systems that act autonomously**, **reason through problems**, and **interact with tools, APIs, and environments** to accomplish tasks. These AI "agents" are different from traditional AI models because they can **plan, make decisions, and take actions** dynamically.

---

## **🔹 Key Characteristics of Agentic AI**
✔ **Autonomy** – Agents execute tasks **without human intervention**.  
✔ **Decision-Making** – Uses **LLMs + Reasoning** to decide next steps.  
✔ **Memory & Context Awareness** – Maintains past knowledge.  
✔ **Tool Usage** – Can call APIs, interact with databases, and fetch live data.  
✔ **Multi-Step Execution** – Performs **multi-turn** workflows (e.g., research, coding, automation).

## **🚀 Examples of Agentic AI in Action**
- 🔹 **AI Chatbots** – Can search, summarize, and schedule meetings.
- 🔹 **AI Researchers** – Agents that scan papers, extract insights, and generate reports.
- 🔹 **Code Assistants** – AI that writes, tests, and debugs code autonomously.
- 🔹 **AI-powered Automation** – Handles emails, CRM updates, or business workflows.
